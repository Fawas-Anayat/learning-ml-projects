California Housing Price Prediction üè†

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting median house values in California districts using Multiple Linear Regression. The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow, from data loading and exploratory analysis to model training, evaluation, and visualization.

üöÄ Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

    To implement a Multiple Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.

    To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics and relationships.

    To train and evaluate the model's performance using standard regression metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.

    To visualize key data insights and the model's predictions.

üìä Dataset

This project utilizes the California Housing dataset, available through scikit-learn's built-in datasets. This dataset contains aggregated demographic and economic features for districts in California from the 1990 California census, with the target variable being the median house value for each district.

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:
Prerequisites

    Python 3+

    Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab)

    Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Fawas-Anayat/learning-ml-projects/tree/house-price-prediction-model
    cd learning-ml-projects/linear_regression_project

    Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

    Install dependencies:

    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Running the Project

    Launch Jupyter Notebook/Lab:

    jupyter notebook
    # or jupyter lab

    Navigate to the notebooks/ directory within the Jupyter interface.

    Open and run code.ipynb cell by cell or all at once.

The notebook will execute the entire machine learning pipeline, print insights to the console, and save all generated plots to the plots/ directory.


üîÆ Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for improving this project:

    Feature Engineering: Create more sophisticated features (e.g., population density, age-squared, interaction terms).

    Feature Scaling: Implement StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to see if it improves model performance or stability.

    Regularization: Experiment with Ridge and Lasso regression to prevent overfitting.

    Residual Analysis: Conduct a deeper analysis of model residuals to identify systematic errors or violations of linear regression assumptions.

    Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find optimal parameters for regularized models.

    Advanced Models: Explore other regression algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting Machines.
